Tech Interview Handbook has and always will be free for our readers. As such, sponsors and advertisers go a long way in keeping the website up and running.

Our handbook has become one of the best resources for software engineering interview preparation, amassing over 10,000 monthly organic referrals from other software engineers on forums, Twitter, coding interview preparation sites, and even by [Ivy League universities such as Yale University](https://ocs.yale.edu/channels/the-technical-interview/).

We boast over 200,000 monthly pageviews from 40,000 to 50,000 unique software engineers who are looking for a job and preparing for interviews.
