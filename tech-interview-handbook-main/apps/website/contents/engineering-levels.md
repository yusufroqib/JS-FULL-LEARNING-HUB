Understanding the various career levels for engineers is crucial because it helps to determine the compensation you should be receiving and also helps you to understand what is expected of you at that level. In most companies where the career levels have been defined, it would resemble something along the lines of: Junior → Software Engineer → Senior → Staff → Senior Staff → Principal → Fellow
