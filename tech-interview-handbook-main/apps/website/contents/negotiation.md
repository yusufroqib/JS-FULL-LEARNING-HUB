## Always negotiate

If you've received an offer (or even better, offers), congratulations! You may heave a huge sigh of relief and think that the toughest parts are over. Well yes, but not entirely! For most people, the reason they're finding a new job is to increase their salary, and salary negotiation is the last stretch in achieving that goal.

**Here's something that recruiters don't want you to know -** In most cases, there's room for negotiation on your offer and recruiters expect candidates to negotiate. **The initial offer that you are given is never the best package that the company can offer.** During my last job hunting experience, I received offers from numerous top tech companies like Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Lyft, Dropbox, and I have found this to be true. In most cases, you could always negotiate for more money, and some aspects of your salary is easier to negotiate than others. With multiple offers in hand, I was able to negotiate a better offer from every company.

## Negotiation services

If you haven't been negotiating your past offers, or are new to the negotiation game, worry not! There are multiple negotiation services that can help you out. Typically, they'd be well-worth the cost. Had I know about negotiation services in the past, I'd have leveraged them!
